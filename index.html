        <h3 style="color: maroon;"><i>2024 has been a year of anticipation and waiting. With much awaited sequels, like Deadpool and Wolverine, and Dune2 coming to the big screens, many of us have been eager to see what Hollywood produces!</i></h3>
        <br/>
        <h3>So, let's take a look!</h3>

        <ol>
            <li><u>Deadpool and Wolverine</u>
                It's no surprise this movie is at number 1. With hearthrob Ryan Reynolds and the forever badass Wolverine, almost everyone has been waiting for this collab since the announcment. It's finally in cinemas on 20th of July! I know I'm booking now!</li>

                <br/>
            
            <li><u>BadBoys: Ride or Die</u>
                The BadBoys franchise has never failed to impress! Since the first release in 1995, the iconic cop duo, played by Will Smith and Martin Lawrence, have delivered a fantastic combination of action, comedy, brotherhood, friendship and just good old crime-busting cop work. Despite some mixed reviews from critics, I personally think this one franchise that is evergreen. Plus, Will Smith has aged like fine wine!</li>

            <p>You Ride Together. You Die Together.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3> Much like the h1 tag, the h2 tag is also another headline tag. Think of h1 as the heading and h2 as a subheading.</h2>

        <ul>
        <ol>Some examples of tags are;</ol> <br/>
    
            <li> the paragraph tag - it has an opening angle, the letter p and a closing angle</li> <br/>
            <li>the line break tag - this is displayed as an opening angle, the letters br and a closing angle</li> <br/>
            <li> the underline tag. For example, <u>underline</u>. The underline tag is nested within another tag, which in this case is the ordered list tag. The tag is used to underline a word on the webpage.</li> <br/>
            <li> the <b>bold tag</b>. This is characterised with the letter b in within an opening and closing angle. It is used to make text bold on your webpage.</li> <br/>
            <li> the final example is the <i>italic</i>tag. This constitutes an opening angle with the letter i and a closing angle.</li> <br/>
        </ul>
    </div>
        <p1>The div tag is used to group sections of code that you want to target with CSS.</p1>
        <hr>
        <h3>So, in summary, different tags have different functions. Some of them are self closing. These are characterised with an opening tag, and a dash with a closing angle.</h3>
